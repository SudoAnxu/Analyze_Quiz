# Quiz Performance Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes a user's quiz performance using data from their latest quiz submission and historical quiz data. It provides insights into areas of improvement and recommendations for further study. The application aims to help users understand their strengths and weaknesses in various topics and improve their overall performance in quizzes.

## Features
- Analyzes current quiz performance metrics (score, accuracy, etc.)
- Evaluates performance trends over the last five quizzes
- Identifies weak areas based on historical performance
- Generates recommendations for improvement
- Visualizes quiz performance data through various plots

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The programming language used for the project.
- **Pandas**: A library for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Requests**: A library for making HTTP requests to fetch data from APIs.
- **Matplotlib**: A plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
- **Seaborn**: A statistical data visualization library based on Matplotlib.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SudoAnxu/Analyze_Quiz.git
   cd Analyze_Quiz
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended)**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment**
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Run the Application**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Approach Description
1. **Data Acquisition**: The application fetches quiz data from specified API endpoints using the `requests` library.
2. **Data Preparation**: It processes the raw JSON data into a format suitable for analysis, extracting relevant metrics and organizing them into DataFrames.
3. **Performance Analysis**: It calculates performance metrics such as scores, accuracy, and identifies weak areas based on historical performance.
4. **Recommendations Generation**: Based on identified weak areas, the application generates actionable recommendations for improvement.
5. **Data Visualization**: The application visualizes key metrics using Matplotlib and Seaborn, providing insights into user performance trends and areas for focus.
